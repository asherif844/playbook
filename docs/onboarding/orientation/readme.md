## What is The Commitment?

As a CSA, you aren't obligated to complete onboarding in a particular deadline.

Once you've entered as a team member onto a partner engagement, you are committed to continuing with the engagement until it's complete. The reason for this is that others rely on you as part of a team to execute an engagement successfully.

Once you've completed the engagement you can choose to no longer take on additional engagements for Code-with.
