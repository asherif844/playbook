# Onboarding and Readiness

Onboarding is intended to take a Cloud Solution Architect:

-   Create readiness for fulfilling a Code-with engineer role
-   Enable the deliverly of deep, software development level engagements 
-   Readiness for practicing the Code-with Playbook principles that fulfill the three goals of the Code-with mission.

## Objectives

Code-with isn't just about partner engagements, but a community of collaboration, growth, and learning. As part of onboarding, you will:

-   Complete required, comprehensive training so that you can meet engagement demands 
-   Learn the Code-with Principles, and model the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically.
-   Learn to be responsible to a team, both technically and operationally
-   Learn to execute as a team member on an engagement to achieve a broader context and outcome 

# Getting Started

The onboarding process defines the experience of the Code-with engineer from the day you join to the day you deliver. It has two parts: 

1.  [Orientation][orientation]
2.  [Delivery Readiness](readiness)

## 1. Orientation

Orientation is focused on helping you get started with the onboarding process. A checklist will be provided and someone will be supporting you throughout the process.

## 2. Delivery Readiness 

Delivery readiness is structured into three segments:

1.  Gaining technical working knowledge 
2.  Practicing software development methodologies and 
3.  Application through a simulation and shadowing an active engagement

### Problems

- Code-with is a team sport, everyone impacts one another now
- what if we engage and the team isn't ready? (because in CW, the team succeeds together not individually)
