# Training Plan

The Code-with learning plan is primarily driven by Pluralsight, so you will want to get your account setup right away. Please contact the Code-with program lead to get your account setup.

Materials used for your learning plan, include:

- Pluralsight
- Videos & tutorials
- Reading material including books, articles, and whitepapers

## Skill Level

Because of the nature of the work, a Code-with engineer must act as a full stack developer. To take the "guess work" out,  Code-with use Pluralsight to drive our learning plan. There is a tool called the [Skills IQ](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/skill-iq) that will measure your progress. 

### Target Skill Level

For each course in the training, the Code-with engineer will attain __proficiency__ level in the Skill IQ on Pluralsight.

## FAQs

__How long will this take me?__\
Every CSA will have varying degrees of technical competency in the skillsets needed to be a Code-with engineer, so we don't have a specific time frame.
