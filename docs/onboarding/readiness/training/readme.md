# Training Plan

The Code-with learning plan is primarily driven by Pluralsight, so you will want to get your account setup right away. Please contact the Code-with program lead to get your account setup.

Materials used for your learning plan, include:

- Pluralsight
- Videos & tutorials
- Reading material including books, articles, and whitepapers

## Overview 

Before beginning your training, please go through orientation which will set you up with a [pluralsight account0(./onboarding/orientation/pluralsight.md). Next, you will do the following:

1.  Perform a self-assessment (using Pluralsight skill IQ system) of each course within the training topics
2.  Begin your training plan (based on areas of proficiency)
3.  Review your Pluralsight transcript with your onboarding buddy, demonstrating proficiency in targeted arease
4.  Schedule your simulation

## Skill Level

Because of the nature of the work, a Code-with engineer must act as a full stack developer. To take the "guess work" out,  Code-with use Pluralsight to drive our learning plan. There is a tool called the [Skills IQ](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/skill-iq) that will measure your progress. 

### Target Skill Level

For each course in the training, the Code-with engineer will attain __proficiency__ level in the Skill IQ on Pluralsight.

## FAQs

__How long will this take me?__\
Every CSA will have varying degrees of technical competency in the skillsets needed to be a Code-with engineer, so we don't have a specific time frame.
