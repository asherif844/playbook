# Simulation

## Prerequisitives

Participating in the simulations means you've completed all the training content.

## Objective

The simulation exists to practice the following things:

-   Execution of the code-with engineer role as a team
-   Breaking down a problem and design from requirements / user stories
-   Applying the technical training (tools, writing code, design, etc.), and deploying to Azure

The simulation is not a pass/fail test, and shouldn't be treated as one. Instead, the focus is on putting into practice what's been learned. As a Cloud Solution Architect in the OCP "swarm", the execution of engagements is primarily a solo activity. In the simulation, the intent is to practice development as a "team sport". 

## Overview

-   Duration: 1 week (5 business days)
-   Team: 3-5 people will form a team
-   Objective: setup tools, design, and implement the case study as a team

### What to expect

-   Reserve the entire week's time for the simulation. You will be completely dedicated

### Requirements

While the focus of the simulation is not to grade anyone, each code-with engineer candidate is expected to actively experience the software development process, each participant must complete the following activities:

-   [ ] Participate in a code review (give comments, discuss code, approval/denial, etc.)
-   [ ] Submit code in a code review (receive feedback, respond, merge the code)
-   [ ] Write at least 20+ lines of relevant code (class, functions, etc.)
-   [ ] Write a least one unit test, minimum
-   [ ] Leave a history, showing you pushed code everyday to a branch in a Git repository
-   [ ] Create at least one Docker image (build and/or create Dockerfile)
-   [ ] Templates or scripts that demonstrate infrastructure as code (at least one thing)


Remember, these represent the bare minimum.
