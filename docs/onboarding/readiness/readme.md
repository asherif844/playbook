# Delivery Readiness

Delivery readiness requires that each Code-with engineer is able to function with a baseline set of skills and competencies in specific set of core technologies.

## Overview 

1.   [Training](./training/readme.md)
2.  [Simulation](./simulation/readme.md)
3.  [Shadowing](./shadowing/readme.md)

## Training

Every Code-with engineer follows a training process that starts with mandatory, initial training courses in a specific set of technologies. Training covers topics such as:

-   Software development tools
-   Programming languages
-   Software patterns and practices (including architectural styles)
-   Technical stack implementations (frameworks, platforms, libraries, etc.)

## Simulation

The simulation isn't meant as a "final test." It's intended to put into practice what you've learned to then learn to apply your existing and net new knowledge and skills.

## Shadowing

The last activity in delivery readiness, is to shadow a code-with engineer on an active engagement for 1-2 weeks.
