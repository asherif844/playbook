# Envisioning Agenda

## 4 Session Agenda

A virtual series of four sessions can be run to cover the envisioning and architectural design session.  It can be used in place of the tradation all-day in-person Envisioning and Architectural Design Sessions.  The four sessions are:
* Architecture Review 
* Technical Deep Dives
* Backlog Review
* Next Steps / Planning

### Architecture Review

The architecture review is partner-lead and covers the current architecture or proposed architecture if one has already been chosen. When reviewing the technical architecture during this session, it should be in the context of the high-level solution objectives or requirements.  A review of the current/proposed team structure and DevOps process should be reviewed as well.

For the architecture review session, it is helpful if the partner is able to provide any materials that will help create the following session outputs:
* High-level timelines
* Team resources and roles
* User personas
* Functional requirements
* Non-functional requirements
* Integration points or dependencies
* SLA and high availability strategies
* Logical architecture diagrams
* DevOps process flow
* Software stack / frameworks


### Technical Deep Dives

The technical deep dive is used to dig into the physical architecture of the current or proposed solution. There will be more focus on the non-functional requirements, software stacks, domain model, storage design, etc.

For the technical deep dive, it is helpful if the partner is able to provide any materials that will help create the following session outputs:
* Domain model
* Physical architecture
* Application Architecture at the component level
* Storage schema
* Migration requirements prior to development (data, source code, etc)


### Backlog Review

The backlog review session is a collaborative session to create and review user stories in a backlog.  During code-with sprints, the code-with team will work on user stories from the backlog, so the output of this session is a populated and understood backlog of user stories.  

For the backlog review, it would be helpful if the partner is able to share and describe any existing user stories in the backlog.  If there are no existing user stories in a backlog, this session will be focused on creating them.  In either case, it is important that the partner includes the business/domain experts in the session.
