# Envisioning Agenda

## 4 Session Agenda

A virtual 4 session agenda is used to cover an Envisioning and Architectural Design Session over 4 virtual half-day sessions.  The four sessions are:
* Architecture Review 
* Technical Deep Dives
* Backlog Review
* Next Steps / Planning

### Architecture Review

The architecture review is partner-lead and covers the current architecture or proposed architecture if one has already been proposed. When reviewing the technical architecture, it should be in the context of the high-level solution objectives or requirements.
