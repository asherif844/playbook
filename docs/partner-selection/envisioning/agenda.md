# Envisioning Agenda

## 4 Session Agenda

A virtual 4 session agenda is used to cover an Envisioning and Architectural Design Session over 4 virtual half-day sessions.  The four sessions are:
* Architecture Review 
* Technical Deep Dives
* Backlog Review
* Next Steps / Planning

### Architecture Review

The architecture review is partner-lead and covers the current architecture or proposed architecture if one has already been proposed. When reviewing the technical architecture, it should be in the context of the high-level solution objectives or requirements.  A review of the current/proposed team structure and DevOps process should be reviewed as well.

For the architecture review session, it is helpful if the partner is able to provide any materials that will help create the following session outputs:
* User Personas
* Functional Requirements
* Non-functional requirements
* Integration points or dependencies
* SLA and high availability strategies
* Logical architecture diagrams
* DevOps process flow

### Technical Deep Dives

The technical deep dive is used to dig into the physical architecture of the current or proposed solution. There will be more focus on the non-functional requirements, software stacks, domain model, storage design, etc.

For the technical deep dive, it is helpful if the partner is able to provide any materials that will help create the following session outputs:
* Physical Architecture
* Domain Model
* Software stack / frameworks
* Storage schema / technology
*
