# Partner Selection
The partner selection process is designed to ensure that the OCP Code With team and the partner are properly aligned on goals and expectations. An initial discussion with the partner will be scheduled to educate the partner on the code with team and its engagement model. During this discussion, the partner opportunity will also be introduced to the code with team, covering the business drivers, high level timelines, partner staff resources dedicated to the project, potential tech stack, and how much existing software is expected to be reused.

If the initial call with the partner indicates that this could be a potential fit for both the partner and OCP, an envisioning session will be scheduled for a mutually agreed upon time.

## Envisioning
The envisioning phase in intended to gain a detailed technical understanding of the technical architecture, development practices, and environment, so that both the code with team and partner can make a descision on whether or not to move forward with scheduling the project. The envisioning phase is made up to two distinct sessions that can be scheduled consecutively or at different times. The two sessions are:
* Envisioning Session (1 day)
* Architectural Design Session (2-3 days)
